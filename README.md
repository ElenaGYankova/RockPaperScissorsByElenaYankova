Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game (jk it's just you), where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The rules are as follows:

‚Ä¢	`Rock` beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock);

‚Ä¢	`Scissors` beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors);

‚Ä¢	`Paper` beats rock (the paper covers the rock);

The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g., "paper"), the game outcome is "draw".
